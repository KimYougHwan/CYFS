# Compile and deploy DIY OOD

To deploy a DIY OOD on your own machine, you can choose:
1. Use our binary installer, or
2. Compile your own OOD System from source code and deploy it on your host.

## Install packages using precompiled binaries
You can download the binary installation package of the corresponding system from [download.md](../Download.md) or our official website [cyfs.com](https://www.cyfs.com).   After downloading, simply execute the installation package. This installation package will do the following:
- If it's a non-windows system, check the libc version to make sure it meets our precompiled binary requirements
- If node.js is not installed on the system, install the LTS version of node.js. Installing a package does not check the installed node.js version
- If mongodb is not installed in the system, install mongodb version 4.4
- If it is a non-windows system and docker is not installed on the system, install the latest docker-ce version
- Download the latest OOD Service files from Service Repo servers owned by CYFS Core Dev Team
- Deploy the OOD Service locally and start it
> The precompiled binary installers have been tested on the following systems:
> - Windows 10/11
> - Ubuntu 18/20
> - Centos 7/8
> - Debian 9
>
> Other Windows systems not listed, Debian-based and RedHat-based systems may also be supported. CYFS Core Dev Team has not tested on other systems

If your target system is not in the supported list, you can also choose to compile and deploy the OOD Service yourself. CYFS OOD theoretically supports most Windows and Linux/Unix-like systems

## Compile your own OOD Service components from source code and deploy them

If you don't want to use precompiled binaries, or you have made your own changes to the code, we also support compiling all the components required by OOD and deploying to any machine with the same system.

### Preparation before compilation
Currently, the compilation scripts we provide do not support cross-compilation, but you can modify the scripts we provide to achieve cross-compilation
The compiler of OOD Service needs to meet the following requirements:
> - Node.js 14 or above: required to execute compile scripts, if not using compile scripts, this dependency is not required
> - rustc 1.57 or above

### Compile OOD Service from script
First, in the root directory of the source code, execute the command `npm i` to install various dependencies required by the script

During the compilation process of the script, the `${cyfs_root}` folder needs to be created. If the current system or current user does not have permission to create this folder, you need to manually create the `${cyfs_root}` folder in advance and assign read and write permissions to the current user

`${cyfs_root}` specific path:
- Windows: `c:\cyfs`
- MacOS: `~/Library/cyfs`
- Other systems: `/cyfs`

In the `src` folder of the source code, execute the command `node ../scripts/build-standalone.js`, this script will compile the OOD Service and the tools required for local deployment, and complete the initial local deployment. Finally generate the installer `ood-installer`

Before compiling, you can specify the version number and the channel used by the Service through the two environment variables `CYFS_BUILD_NUMBER` and `CYFS_BUILD_CHANNEL`. The optional value for Channel can currently only be `nightly`. If these two environment variables are not specified, the default version number is 0 and the channel is nightly

For the specific steps of compilation, please refer to the build-standalone.js code. More detailed documentation will be added later

### Deploy OOD Service
After compiling, it will
- Generate the `${cyfs_root}/repo_store` directory, which stores the locally compiled OOD Service binary files according to a certain format.
- Under the `src` folder, generate the `ood-installer` installer.

Before installation, you need to prepare the dependency environment of OOD yourself:
- Node.js 14.x
- MongoDB version 4.4, configured to start at boot, use the default port, no authentication
- The latest version of docker-ce, configured to start at boot

Execute the command `./ood-installer --target solo`, and the locally compiled binary will be installed as the OOD Service

The compiled OOD Service components can be used to deploy to other machines in the same system:

Copy the `${cyfs_root}/repo_store` directory to the same directory on the new machine, copy the `ood-installer` program to any directory on the new machine, and execute the above installation command.
