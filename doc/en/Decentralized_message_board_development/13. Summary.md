# web3 brings developers a real serverlese development experience

Congratulations, you reached the last subsection of this tutorial, give yourself a thumbs up!

The CYFS R&D team has tested the reusable modular server module function. In the near future, we will formulate a standard server module specification to bring developers a modular serverlese development experience!

We look forward to the killer application of web3 to be built in the hands of you or your team, and become the Zuckerberg of the free Internet!
